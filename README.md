# Design a class structure for cars

Think about the real life and imagine what the cars look like. That will help you get ideas into the code

## Requirements

Use the following if you can or needed:

- Abstract classes
- Inheritance (to represent different cars)
- Virtual methods/properties
- Enums
- Structs if needed
- Override methods from Object class as needed
- Construct a few car objects and test out in Program.cs
- Remember the conventions: Put classes in different files (with property naming)

## Run the program

`dotnet run --project CarBuilder`
